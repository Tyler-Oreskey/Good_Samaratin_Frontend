# Good_Samaratin_Frontend

**project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_fjINvsucw&feature=youtu.be**

Good Samaratin is a full-stack ios application that allows the user to to see what needs to be done when there is an emergency.
The emergencies are anything injury related, and each emergency has a list of steps on how to help yourself or someone else.
The emergencies and list of steps are retrieved from the Good Samaratin backend using get requests from the API live on Heroku.
The user can take a quiz that is also retrieved from the database showing their basic knowledge on what to do in emergency situations.
One very important feature is that the user can call 911 on every page just in case if something is life threatening. (The number
doesn't call 911, but its easy to change).
One thing I would like to add is a user profile section that connects to a database of medical skills that a user can add to their own profile.
Another thing I would add is a section in the user profile that keeps quiz scores from the quizzes that the user attempts, so that others can see how much they know.
